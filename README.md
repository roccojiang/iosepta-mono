# Iosepta Mono

A personal custom build of the [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) font, based off the SS18 ([Input Mono](https://input.djr.com/)) stylistic set.

## Sample Images

The `images/` directory contains sample images showing Iosepta Mono's character differences from base Iosevka. Characters that differ are highlighted in blue.

### Regenerating Samples

Sample images are automatically regenerated by GitHub Actions when `.iosevka-version` or `private-build-plans.toml` changes.

To regenerate locally (requires Docker):

```bash
make samples
```

This builds a Docker image with all dependencies and generates:
- `images/iosepta-samples.json` — config with hot characters and features
- `images/iosepta-upright.{light,dark}.svg` — upright samples
- `images/iosepta-italic.{light,dark}.svg` — italic samples
